Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States

## Abstract

This project aims to develop a deep-learning solution for accurately detecting sleep onset and wake events using wrist-worn accelerometer data. Leveraging
a supervised learning approach, the project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and selecting suitable deep learning architectures. After training and validation, the model’s performance will be evaluated, and predictions will be generated for test data. The project follows a structured plan, including documentation and optional deployment, to advance sleep event detection for improved sleep monitoring and understanding. Future enhancements and extensions are also considered to enhance the model’s capabilities further.

## Problem Statement

The problem to be solved in this competition is accurately detecting sleep onset and wakefulness using wrist-worn accelerometer data. Researchers aim to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying the sleep state of individuals based on the accelerometer data, distinguishing between periods of sleep and wakefulness.

### Why it’s Important: This problem is of significant importance for several reasons

1. Improving Sleep Studies: Current sleep monitoring methods, such as sleep logs and heuristic-based software, have limitations and are unsuitable for large-scale studies. Automating sleep state detection from accelerometer data can significantly enhance the feasibility and reliability of sleep studies.
2. Understanding Sleep Patterns: Sleep plays a crucial role in overall health, development, and cognitive functioning. Accurate sleep state detection can provide valuable insights into
sleep patterns, helping researchers better understand the nuances of sleep, its impact on various populations, and how environmental factors influence it.
3. Impact on Children and Youth: Sleep is particularly vital for children and youth, as it regulates mood, emotions, and behaviour. Accurate detection of sleep onset and wakefulness can aid in identifying disturbances in sleep patterns among children, contributing to a deeper understanding of mood and behavioural difficulties in this demographic.
4. Personalized Interventions: The results of this competition can lead to the development of personalized interventions and support systems. By identifying sleep patterns and disturbances, researchers can tailor interventions to the unique needs of each individual, potentially improving their mental and emotional well-being.
5. Advancing Mental Health Research: The competition is hosted by the Child Mind Institute (CMI), which focuses on children’s mental health and learning disorders. Accurate sleep monitoring can be a valuable tool in mental health research, enabling the development of innovative approaches to assessment and intervention.

### Expected Results: The expected results of this competition include

1. Development of Effective Models: Successful machine learning models that can accurately classify sleep onset and wakefulness from accelerometer data.
2. Improved Sleep Monitoring: Enhanced tools and methodologies for analyzing sleep data on a large scale, which researchers can use to conduct more reliable and comprehensive sleep studies.
3. Awareness and Guidance: Improved awareness of the importance of sleep and its relationship with various factors, including mood and behaviour.
4. Tailored Interventions: Insights that can inform the development of personalized interventions and support systems for individuals, especially children, with sleep-related challenges.
5. Advancements in Mental Health Research: Contributions to the field of mental health research, aligning with the goals of the Child Mind Institute and the SNF Global Center for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.

In __*summary*__, this competition aims to advance the understanding of sleep, enable more effective sleep monitoring, and ultimately improve the well-being of individuals, especially children, by leveraging wrist-worn accelerometer data and machine learning techniques.

## Deep Learning Task Formulation

### Type of Data

The data used for this deep learning task consists of multi-day recordings of wrist-worn accelerometer data. Each recording contains the following features:

* __series_id__: Unique identifier for the accelerometer series.
* __step__: Integer timestep for each observation.
* __timestamp__: Datetime in ISO 8601 format.
* __anglez__: Z-angle metric derived from accelerometer components.
* __enmo__: Euclidean Norm Minus One computed from accelerometer signals.

### Task Type

This is a supervised learning task. The primary objective is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify two event types based on the accelerometer data: sleep onset and wake-up.

### Objective

This deep learning task aims to train a model that can automatically detect the occurrences of sleep onset and wake-up events within the accelerometer data. The model will be trained on a labelled dataset with sleep event annotations provided in the train events.csv file. The trained model will then be applied to test data to predict sleep events for unseen accelerometer series.
